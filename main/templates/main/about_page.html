            <h6><p>Hello world!</p></h6>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">My name is Matteo and this project was born after I successfully passed my exam of Formal
                Languages and Compilers in January 2018. I cannot stop saying that this course was definitely
                the best of the whole Computer Science course.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">For this reason I thought I could give myself a try with some challenges and proceed with the
                creation of the following parsers, written in Python. Sadly, I know that Python is sub-optimal
                for stuff like this (C could have been much better, of course), but at the moment I am pretty
                confident with it, so here it is.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Some special thanks are given to Davide Benda, who helped me a lot during the testing session
                and made the first release possible.<p>
